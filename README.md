## Problem Definition

- What is the most important factor affecting the price of an Airbnb?
- Is there a relationship between the price of a listing and the key variables selected?

## Machine Learning Techniques Used:

1. Natural Language Processing
2. Linear Regression
3. Decision Tree Regression
4. Support Vector Regression
5. Random Forest Regression

## Conclusion

- Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression & Support Vector Regression do not fit into our analysis due to low performance metrics
- Able to accurately predict the Airbnb price using Random Forest Regression along with the variables
